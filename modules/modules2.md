We can bring module paths into scope with the ``use`` keyword, combined with the ``as`` keyword we can provide an alias for our paths:
```rust
use path::to::module as alias
```
then use the ``pub`` keyword to make it public and visible when the module is imported as seen below: 

```rust
mod delicious_snacks {
    // TODO: Fix these use statements
    pub use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
    pub use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &'static str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &'static str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &'static str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &'static str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie
    );
}

```
